Tory Hobson is a user interafce & interaction designer in Austin, Texas.

Designing simple and cleam interfaces for the web and mobile applications is what I do best*. I currently do that at NetSpend, where I help shape the future of their line of digital products.

I am currently seeking new freelance opportunities. You can view some of my work at my previous site and on Dribbble, but feel free to email me for more current work samples and a full resume.

*In all honestly, eating as much pizza as humanly possible is really what I do best.
